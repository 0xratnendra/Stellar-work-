# Retainer Contract Reference

The `contracts/retainer` smart contract implements periodic retainer agreements and cross-chain job escrow interoperability on Stellar Soroban. It provides recurring milestone-based payouts without custodial platform intermediaries, sliding-window rate limiting, trusted-caller bypasses, and cross-chain export/import records.

---

## Architecture & Lifecycle

A retainer is established by a client for a freelancer with an agreed amount per billing interval, defined in ledgers. At each interval, the retainer can be renewed up to `max_renewals`. Once `max_renewals` is reached, the retainer transitions to `Completed`. The client can cancel an active retainer at any time, transitioning it to `Cancelled`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active: create_retainer()
    Active --> Active: renew_retainer() [current_renewal < max_renewals]
    Active --> Completed: renew_retainer() [current_renewal >= max_renewals]
    Active --> Cancelled: cancel_retainer() [client auth]
    Completed --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

### Rate Limiting & Security Model

Calls to rate-limited public entrypoints (`create_retainer`, `renew_retainer`, `cancel_retainer`) are evaluated by `enforce_rate_limit`:
1. **Trusted Address Bypass**: If `is_trusted_address(caller)` is `true`, the call proceeds immediately without consuming quota.
2. **Rate Limit Policy**: When `max_calls > 0`, the contract tracks calls made within a sliding time window (`window_seconds`). Exceeding `max_calls` returns `Error::RateLimitExceeded (9)`.
3. **Window Reset**: Once `now - window_started_at >= window_seconds`, the counter resets to 1 and starts a new window.
4. **Administrative Controls**: Admin functions (`export_job`, `import_job`, `set_rate_limit`, `set_trusted_address`) require explicit admin signature via `require_admin`.

## Data Structures

### `RetainerStatus` (Enum)
Represents the operational state of a retainer agreement.
- `Active`: Agreement is ongoing and eligible for periodic renewals.
- `Completed`: All allowed renewal periods (`max_renewals`) have been reached and finalized.
- `Cancelled`: Terminated early by the client.

### `Retainer` (Struct)
| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `client` | `Address` | Stellar address of the client funding the retainer. |
| `freelancer` | `Address` | Stellar address of the service provider receiving payments. |
| `amount` | `i128` | Payment amount disbursed per interval. |
| `interval_ledgers` | `u64` | Minimum elapsed time (in ledger timestamp seconds) required between renewals. |
| `max_renewals` | `u32` | Maximum number of renewal payout cycles before contract completion. |
| `current_renewal` | `u32` | Number of successful renewals executed so far. |
| `status` | `RetainerStatus` | Current lifecycle status (`Active`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`). |
| `created_at` | `u64` | Ledger timestamp (Unix seconds) when the retainer was created. |
| `token` | `Address` | Soroban token address used for settlement. |

### `RateLimitConfig` (Struct)
| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_calls` | `u32` | Maximum invocations allowed per window (0 disables rate limiting). |

## Error Codes

| Code | Variant | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not authorized to perform the operation (e.g., non-admin or non-client). |
| `2` | `NotFound` | Retainer or cross-chain job record does not exist for the provided ID. |
| `3` | `InvalidStatus` | Operation cannot be performed in the current `RetainerStatus`. |
| `4` | `IntervalNotPassed` | Insufficient time has elapsed since the last renewal (`now < last_renewed_at + interval_ledgers`). |
| `5` | `MaxRenewalsReached` | Retainer has already completed all scheduled renewal cycles. |
| `6` | `AlreadyInitialized` | Contract has already been initialized with an admin. |
| `7` | `NotInitialized` | Contract has not yet been initialized. |
| `8` | `InvalidRateLimitConfig` | Invalid rate limit configuration (both fields must be 0 or >0; max window 30 days). |
| `9` | `RateLimitExceeded` | Invocations in the current window exceeded `max_calls`. |

# Initialize
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
